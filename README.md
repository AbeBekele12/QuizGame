# Quiz App README

This is a simple quiz app built using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Getting Started

To run the app, you need to have Flutter installed on your development machine. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, please follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository and open it in your preferred code editor.

## App Description

The quiz app consists of two main components: `Brain` and `QuizPage`.

### `Brain` Class

The `Brain` class contains the logic and data for the quiz questions and answers. It provides methods to get the current question, the correct answer, and move to the next question. You can find the implementation of the `Brain` class in the `Brain.dart` file.

### `QuizPage` Widget

The `QuizPage` widget is a stateful widget responsible for displaying the quiz interface and handling user interactions. It utilizes the `Brain` class to retrieve questions, check user answers, and keep track of the user's score.

## Running the App

To run the app on a simulator or emulator, navigate to the root of the project and execute the following command:

```
flutter run
```

The app will start and open on the selected simulator/emulator, displaying the quiz questions. You can answer each question by clicking on the "True" or "False" buttons. The app will provide immediate feedback with a checkmark (for a correct answer) or a cross (for an incorrect answer). Your score will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Customization

You can easily customize the quiz questions by modifying the `questions` list in the `Brain.dart` file. Each question is represented as an instance of the `Questions` class, which contains the `question` (a String) and `answer` (a boolean) properties.

Feel free to customize the app's appearance by changing colors, font styles, or button layouts in the `QuizPage` widget.

## Additional Features

This version of the app doesn't include features such as a timer or multiple quiz categories, but you can expand the app by adding these features or enhancing the user interface to make it more engaging.

## Dependencies

This app uses the following dependencies:

- `flutter/material.dart`: The Flutter framework for building UI components.
- `rflutter_alert`: A package for displaying custom alert dialogs.
- `Brain.dart`: A custom class to manage quiz questions and answers.

Please ensure that you have these dependencies listed in your `pubspec.yaml` file to run the app successfully.

## Conclusion

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of how this quiz app works and how to run it on your local development environment. Feel free to explore, experiment, and expand the app's functionality according to your needs.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
